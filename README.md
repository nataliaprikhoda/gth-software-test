    <summary>Task requirements</summary>

    1. Create a new Vue or React project, where you can start working on the task.
    2. Prepare a page that has 3 sections, as demonstrated in the above example. Design the UI as you wish. Make sure itâ€™s also responsive.
    3. In the right section of the page, embed the provided webpage as an iframe in your web application and render it on the screen.
    4. Listen for the messages posted by the embedded page and store them, as you will need to use the data received in the next steps.
    5. Create a counter that starts with the number 0 and position it in the middle section of the page.
    6. Every time a new message is received from the embedded page, increment the counter by the random number received in the message.
    7. In the left section of the page, show a history of the last 5 numbers received.
    8. Add a README file to your project, with the following information:

    - Instructions on how to build and run the project locally.
    - A brief description of your solution, project structure and components.

    9. Pack your solution in a ZIP file and send it to us. Alternatively, you can upload it to a public Git repository (e.g. GitHub) and share the link with us.

## About the project

### Folder structure

Initial folder structure is generated from `create-react-app`

```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ public                  # Files which are not processed by webpack
â”‚                           # and will be copied directly to the build
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ src                     # Source code of the app, which is processed
â”‚   â”‚                       # by webpack and transformed into a single
â”‚   â”‚                       # bundle file
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components          # Shared UI components used across the entire
â”‚   â”‚                       # application
â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ features            # Feature based modules that contain
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚                   # feature-specific code for routes,
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚                   # state, types, etc
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App             # Main feature that defines routes and
â”‚   â”‚   â”‚                   # global store with feature-based slices

```

### State management

State management is implemented with [@reduxjs/toolkit](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-toolkit) package. Global store is initialized within `index.tsx`, and includes store slices from each of the rest features.

### Routing

Routing functionality is implemented with [react-router-dom](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/tree/main/packages/react-router-dom) package. BrowserRouter is initialized within `index.tsx`, and routes are defined within `App` feature.

### Implemented solution

Given task can be separated into 2 parts:

1. Listen to and store data provided by embedded webpage
2. Process stored data and display the result

Main logic for both of the parts can be found in `./src/feature/RandomNumbers/RandomNumbers.tsx`.

- Listening to the posted messages is implemented through `window.addEventListener()` function which is called on first render of the `RandomNumbers` screen
- Each posted number is stored within `randomNumbers` state slice in `allNumbers` array after dispatching `addNumber()` action
- Every time `randomNumbers` slice in global store is updated - `RandomNumbers` screen is re-rendered
- Values for last posted 5 numbers and counter are calculated using utils functions - `getLast5Numbers()`, `formatArrayToString()` and `getSumFromArray()`
- Each UI section has repetitive UI (title and some content) which is separated into reusable component - `Grid.Item` - which represents an atom of composite UI component - `Grid`
